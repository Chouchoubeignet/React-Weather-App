## Objectives :
---

This is my second project in React. The app can :

- use an API to render weather informations from the current day
- use an other API to render weather informations from the next 4 days.

In the Version 0 the code is very light without tests and error catch.

## Technologies used :
---

- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript
- React framework (react, react-dom)
- Axios (API : openWeatherMap.org)
